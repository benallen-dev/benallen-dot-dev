Having an opinion is far more important than looking good if you ask me, so this website is basically me running my mouth. Sometimes I even have good reasons for what I'm saying, but if I don't you can either let me know or submit my rant to your favourite tech streamer.

I program computers. I like to think I'm pretty good at it, but then I decide something stupid like "I want to make my own website without using JavaScript" and then I realise I still suck ass. And then I play with stuff for a bit and hopefully eventually I start kicking ass more than sucking it. 

You get the picture.
