> I am a software developer. I have a passion for software development and I love to learn new things. I am a big fan of the Go programming language and I am currently learning Rust. I also like to play around with Docker and Kubernetes. I am also a big fan of the DevOps culture and I am always looking for ways to improve the way I work.

Good grief that's sickening! ðŸ¤®

That's what Github Copilot wrote for me, and it's the typical LinkedIn-friendly garbage you read all over the place. Let's be real for a second: all programming langues suck in their own, unique way, and ~~sometimes~~ often I have a hot take on topics I don't know enough about.

Having an opinion is far more important than looking good to prospective employers if you 
ask me, so this website is basically me running my mouth.

## Let's try that again

I program computers. I like to think I'm pretty good at it, but then I decide something stupid like "I want to make my own website without using JavaScript" and then I realise I still suck ass. And then I play with stuff for a bit and hopefully eventually I start kicking ass more than sucking it. 

You get the picture.
