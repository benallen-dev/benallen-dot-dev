I built a website so I could publish stuff, and then I didn't publish anything.

Stupid, right? I wanted to write about tech topics, then I got worried that someone might actually read what I wrote and think I was dumb, and starting overthinking everything I wrote.

Not only is this exactly what I keep telling people _not_ to do, it's also dumb because:

- There's a really good chance only 2 people will read this.
- I know for a fact some people think I'm an idiot already.

So here's to treating a blog a little more like Twitter. I'm not a journalist, and the first articles will probably suck because I haven't done any technical writing in a long time. I might as well just get it over with and publish this dumb post as well.
