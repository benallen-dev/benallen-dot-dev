Seriously, I'm just tired of scrum.

Before, I was ok with scrum. It was just a way to organise your work and make sure the right things get done. 

## Who is scrum even for?

It occurs to me that if my developer teammates don't care, and my PO just wants to get the work done, who the hell wants to make and estimate tickets?

< Image of derp colleague insisting we make tickets followed by burndown chart. >

Ooooooohhhhhhhhh.... Right. Crap.

## Instead of planned refinements that interrupt workflows maybe we can just reach out to colleagues

"Oh but Ben not everyone is like that and they're shy and don't wanna bother people".

This is a straight-up skill issue. It's not that hard, just send them a message.

## Basic ass summary that should never see the internet because it is nowhere near nuanced enough

- Scrum is for managers because "velocity" looks good on charts
- Scrum is for POs because people keep asking them when they'll be done (except the answer is always wrong)
- Scrum is for 0.1x developers so they can pretend they actually added value (Look at the story points! while the rest of the team did the actual work for these freeloading jackoffs)
- Scrum is for Scrum Masters because it keeps them employed

- Scrum is not for people who want to get work done
- Scrum is not for people who know software development can go in unexpected ways

- Kanban is for people who want to know what to do next
- Kanban is for devs who sometimes need to adjust requirements or refactor

- Kanban is not for managers because it's hard to tell how much work is getting done
- Kanban is not for POs because they still can't tell anyone how long the project is going to take
- Kanban is not for 0.1x devs because now it'll become super obvious that tickets with their face on em will take forever
- Kanban is not for Scrum Masters because if all there is is a list of prioritised work, what are you going to do during refinements?

TL;DR - RIP Scrum let's just do our jobs k
