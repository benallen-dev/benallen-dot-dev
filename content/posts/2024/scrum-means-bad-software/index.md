- Scrum focuses on estimating tickets
- Estimation is something we all suck at, especially because we are incentivised to seem competent and therefore deliver quickly
- When a ticket says 3 SP that immediately frames how long development should take
- Scrum rewards developers for finishing tickets, incentivising developers to close tickets and ship the second they get something working
- To quote uncle Bob, your job isn't to get it working. That's the first part. Afterwards, you need to clean it up
- New colleague asked questions like
    - How long would this take you
    - Are you satisfied with my velocity
    - I want to quickly start adding value
- These are all lies pushed by Corpo Scrum Agile Coaches and don't lead to better software
- They lead to "getting it done" and not much else.
