Recently I discovered [a blog post titled "Rediscovering the Small Web"](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) written by [Parimal Satyal](https://neustadt.fr/) and it got me thinking.

I remember setting up my first janky website on GeoCities. I paid for janky hosting on grassroots webhosts with out-of-date PHP versions and uploaded my PHP website with FTP.

## Have we lost our way?
big forntend frameworks
tracking everywhere
even php iosn't simple anymore
