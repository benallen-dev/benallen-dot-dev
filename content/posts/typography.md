# H1: What Can I Do With Archetype?

Paragraph: Archetype lets designers like you very quickly and easily create consistent typography styling and spacing live, in the browser. These styles are all underpinned by established typographic best practices meaning less guesswork and more harmonious designs.

Archetype helps you create a design system of consistent, reusable components which can be easily implemented as your finished design is exported as developer-friendly CSS so everyone's happy!

## H2: Sounds Great, Where Do I Start?

Paragraph: It's easy peasy: 1) Start by selecting a visually compatible font pair. 2) Define harmoniously proportioned sizes for all the standard typographic elements your design might require. 3) Set the optimal vertical spacing of all elements in your design. 4) Tweak and refine individual elements to get everything looking exactly the way you want. 5) Export as CSS ready to send to a developer. Job Done.
